# Special-Problems-in-AI

This project was done over the course of the Spring 2022 semester and is a continuation of the research results from the previous semesters. Our first goal this semester was to first design and builda platform with the capability to be mobile that can also support the weight of the Trossem Reactor X150 Robotic Arm as well as other necessary components. 
The second goal of the semester was to refine the voice recognition algorithm that had already been implemented into the Jetson Nano system to achieve recognition of command words. We were also able to install a more advanced 2D laser scanner on the platform for a more automated world map generation.
